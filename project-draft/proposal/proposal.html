		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>
      What makes an NFL player so special, is it talent, athleticism, or just physical attributes? We identified a problem with how young aspiring athletes lack the means to know and understand where the barrier between an average player and a professional player lies. Being unable to determine this boundary can cause a lack of motivation due to the seemingly undefined gap between the player and a professional one. On the other hand, many fans aren’t vying for a roster spot in the NFL, but using our webpage to compare themselves to their favorite professional players would still be entertaining at the very least. One previous existing attempt of solving our problem is called <a href="https://www.mockdraftable.com/"> MockDraftable</a>. It contains a comprehensive database of all the measurements of NFL players in the past 20+ years. It also has a function to compare NFL players to each other by body measurements such as height, wingspan, 40 yd dash time, etc. The problem with this website is that it doesn’t allow much interactivity for users so our webpage will try to solve this issue.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>
      The users of this application can be anyone who are interested in sports, especially young teenagers who have the dream of being a professional NFL player like their idols. We have generally three features as below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search and Filter</li>
      <li>Compare to Pro</li>
      <li>Rank among Friends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The first feature will be a ranking system for all the users. With their own User ID, they could upload their own performance data and check what’s their ranking among all the users. This feature will ask for the user’s permission to make their data public to other users and will return the ranking chart which include all the users performance and the user’s current ranking.The most exciting feature we are going to include is the comparison between the user and the professional players. The user will first input their own heights, weights, wingspan, and some other data. After that, our web app will compare the inputed data with the data of the professional players. Then, the app will find the player whose data are closest to yours, and show the gap between you and this professional player. The half feature would be search and filter. The user can search the professional NFL players based on their name, or they can filter the players based on their positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user will be viewing the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/savvastj/nfl-combine-data"> data</a> of many NFL pro players, including but not limited to their height, weight, and many performance test results. Based on the pro players’ statistics, the user will also be exposed to a comparison of his/her sport performance and many advice on improvements to make the user “pro.”The problem we are trying to solve is for prospective players who want to improve their sport performance. The website will return statistical conclusions about the gap between the user and proplayers in the NFL league. By providing advice for the user on what to and how to improve his/her current status, the user can virtually save time and increase efficiency on his/her way to the training goal.
